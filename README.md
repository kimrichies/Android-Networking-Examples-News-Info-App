Android Networking Examples: MUST Info AppThis Android application, developed in Java, serves as a practical demonstration for the "Using Internet Resources" module of a computer science course. It showcases three distinct, modern techniques for fetching and displaying web content within a mobile app.The project is designed as a learning tool to contrast different approaches to network data handling, from displaying live web pages to consuming structured APIs and parsing unstructured HTML.Features ImplementedThis app demonstrates the following core functionalities:Displaying a Live Website (WebView)Opens the official Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) website directly within the app.Purpose: Shows the simplest way to integrate existing web content.Source: https://must.ac.ugConsuming a REST API (Retrofit & Gson)Fetches a list of sample posts from a public JSON API (JSONPlaceholder).Parses the JSON response into Java objects automatically.Displays the data in a native list (RecyclerView), with images loaded using Glide.Purpose: Demonstrates the industry-standard method for interacting with structured data from a server.Web Scraping HTML Content (Jsoup)Scrapes live news articles from public news websites like chimpreports.com and must.ac.ug/news.Parses the raw HTML to extract titles, summaries, images, and links.Displays the extracted data in a native RecyclerView.Purpose: Shows an advanced technique for extracting data from websites that do not provide a public API.Technologies and Libraries UsedLanguage: JavaPlatform: Android SDKNetworking (API): Retrofit - A type-safe HTTP client for making network requests.JSON Parsing: Gson - A Google library to convert JSON strings into Java objects.HTML Parsing (Web Scraping): Jsoup - A powerful library for parsing and manipulating HTML.Image Loading: Glide - An efficient library for loading, caching, and displaying images from the web.UI Components:RecyclerView: For displaying scrollable lists efficiently.WebView: For rendering web pages within the app.Concurrency: ExecutorService and Handler for performing network operations off the main UI thread.How to Set Up and RunClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
Open in Android Studio:Launch Android Studio.Select File > Open and navigate to the cloned project folder.Sync Gradle:Android Studio will automatically sync the project and download the required dependencies (Retrofit, Jsoup, Glide, etc.).Run the App:Connect an Android device or start an emulator.Click the "Run" button in Android Studio.The app requires an active internet connection to function correctly.Data SourcesThis educational project utilizes the following public web resources:Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST):Website: https://must.ac.ug (Used in the WebView feature).News Portal: https://must.ac.ug/news (Used in the Jsoup web scraping feature).Public REST API:JSONPlaceholder: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts (Used in the Retrofit feature to fetch sample data).Public News Website for Web Scraping:ChimpReports: https://chimpreports.com/ (Used as another example for the Jsoup web scraping feature).LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
